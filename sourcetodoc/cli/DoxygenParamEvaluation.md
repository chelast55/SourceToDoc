# Doxygen Param Evaluations

This serves as an overview of all potential parameters for doxygen, which are normally configured via the Doxygen.in-file.
Every parameter is paired with an evaluation of whether it makes sense to have it be configurable by the user and why.

Notes:
- possible/default values are sometimes not given for unsupported parameters
- Boolean values in the Doxyfile.in are set with strings of "YES"/"NO", rather than True/False
- When no other explanation is given, the parameter is probably a useful feature to the user and has low/no potential for causing problems
