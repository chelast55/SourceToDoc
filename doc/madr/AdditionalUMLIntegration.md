# Additional UML Diagram Integration

## Context and Problem Statement

- [clang-uml](https://clang-uml.github.io/) (in combination with [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/)) can be used to generate additional UML diagrams (to the ones generated by doxygen's dot tool ([Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/)) implementation)
- there is no proper integration into doxygen-generated API documentation (i.e. to insert sequence diagrams next to the corresponding functions' documentation)
- we want the generated diagrams to be accessible (in a somewhat organized way / at least better than just laying loose in a directory)

## Considered Options

* separate, plain and simple HTML page(s)
* proper integration into doxygen output

## Decision Outcome

Because of the time constrains within the later part of the project, where this whole feature block is set, a solution with separate HTML pages was chosen and the feature is explicitely framed as "experimental" 
(which is not necessarily bad, as the diagrams still can be a little unoptimized and show some redundancy compared to the graphics generated by doxygen, but especially in the sequence diagrams is potential to be found).  
The main page of the generated doxygen API documentation will contain a link to the UML diagram "index" page, when UML diagram generation is enabled.


## Pros and Cons of the Options

### separate HTML pages
* (+) relatively quick and easy
* (-) not as seamlessly usable
* frames it more as a "proof of concept"

### proper doxygen integration
* (+) better usability gains
* (-) likely complicated and time-intensive
* could reuse parts of the implementation for the linking of
