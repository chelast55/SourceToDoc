```
The `out` directory and all of its contents are automatically generated after running `main.py`. ``out`` 
should generally contain everything generated by the toolchain.\
\
`conf.py` and `ìndex.rst` are the "main config files" for sphinx. If any manual modifications are desired, 
Sphinx must be executed manually with `sphinx-build -b html . <PATH TO out>`, because running `main.py` again 
will reset them.\
`doc` contains the generated documentation, which should be most of, if not all, of the toolchain's output.
Here, it first contains a directory with the input project's name. This way `doc` is intended as a collection of 
documentation of potentially multiple input projects. An option to swap the order of these directories will be 
added to better suite the use case of simply generating a `doc` folder to paste right into the input project.\
The innermost of these two directory serves as the root directory for the generated documentation by 
containing the main page (``index.html``), the alphabetical index page (`genindex.html`) and the search page 
(`search.html` + `searchindex.js`). Additionally, it also contains various further directories with pages 
linked in/accessible via ``index.html``, but also various intermediate artifacts (doxygen, breathe, rst and 
rst.txt files) generated within the toolchain. Unfortunately, this whole "intermediate situation" is a little 
bit convoluted, because some of the tools do not allow to specify all output paths for their intermediate 
artifacts. By default, these artefacts are not deleted automatically, because they could serve a further 
purpose not considered within this toolchain (yet) or may be edited to the users' liking before manually 
running Sphinx again.\
``.doctrees`` contains doxygen's intermediate files (doctrees) and mimics the hierarchy within `out` to 
`src/exhale`. doxygen's XML output is located in `src/doxygen/xml`. \
``src/exhale`` contains the .rst and .rst.include files generated by exhale.\
``_sources`` also follows the structure until ``src/exhale``, but contains Sphinx intermediate text files 
(.rst.txt). This structure is seen once again, but from the perspective of ``out/doc/<PROJECT>`` starting 
from ``doc`` and containing the final .html files, representing the doxygen XML output, generated by Sphinx.\
Finally, ``_static`` contains style information mostly dependent on the selected Sphinx HTML template.
